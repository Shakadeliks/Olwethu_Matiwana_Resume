        <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">Developer based in Cape Town, South Africa</p>

        <div  class="about-me__body">
            <p>I am a 25 year-old junior developer from Cape Town, South Africa. I have an immense passion for music and tech, which led to me to discover coding and web development as an option for a career during last years lockdown.
                After doing 2 years of university, at 2 different institutions, in 2015 and 2016, I learnt that university was not the place and format for me to advance myself towrds my goals.
            after dropping out at the top of 2017 I set out on a path to find out how I would make my stamp in the world. Music had forver been a part of my life but I wanted a profession that would allow me to express myself creatively,
            but also provide me with skills that could allow me to bring forth real world solutions.</p>
            
            <p>As mentioned before, I discovered coding on a journey down the Yutube rabbit hole, while I had too much time on my hands during lockdown. I was immediately enthralled by how people just like me were lerning to code and creating 
                software as they pleased. As a big consumer of the internet since around 2007, I felt the best area for me to start was in web development. To be honest, the process of learning how to code has been the toughest challenge of my life, even more so than university.
                However, this is the first time since me starting music, that something has kept me so engaged, even in the face of the level of difficulty being so high.
            </p>

            <p>I have an immense desire to be a pro-active part of creating, designing and maintaining great web applications and more during my career. I eventually want to invest time into further innovatng the intersection between music 
                and tech to create platforms that can greatly benefit musicians and artists and also advance the way in which people consume music .
